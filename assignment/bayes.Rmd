# The observations made are,when i selected the data from sample the chance of getting the values is equally likely among the sample of 50, when increased the sample size the chance maintained in and around the same for the sampling method - frequncy method

# where as when i have the probalisitic method , with the increase in size the probability started going down a lot. so the probability of getting 1 in 10000 dices is not as same in sampling frequency method approach.
